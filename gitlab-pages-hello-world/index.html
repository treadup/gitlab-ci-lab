        <h2>Hello World with Gitlab Pages</h2>
        <p>There are two things you have to do to get GitLab pages up and
            running.</p>
        <p>First you have to create a public/ folder that contains the files you
            want published to the web. These files can be checked in or generated
            by GitLab CI. All that matters is that in the end you want to have files
            in the public/ folder.</p>
        <p>Second you have to enable GitLab Pages for the current project.</p>
        <p>GitLab Pages seems extremely slow when it comes to the initial creation
            of the page. The initial creation of the page seems to take around 5 to 10
            minutes.</p>
        <p>Updating a GitLab Pages project that is already published takes no noticable
            time from once the build pipeline is complete</p>
